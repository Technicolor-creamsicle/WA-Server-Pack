#  ** There is special handling for '[rewardString]'.  This was designed to be used in the 'ontime' (self) and 'ontime <playername.' (other) commands.
#      Because it is possible to use the 'ontime rewards set' command a player can have more than one scheduled reward.  When '[rewardString]' is used
#      the plugin will generate multiple lines of the same format, one for each of the scheduled rewards for that player.  Any variable used
#      on the same line will also be used in each of the reward output lines.
