# Output Configuration Syntax Rules
# *** BE CAREFUL *** since this is a yml file the format is very important.  NEVER use TABs to create space, always use 'spaces'
#
# Every output string must be contained within single quote marks (')
# Color codes can be used, but codes must begin with "&" and must followed by a space (' ')  e.g. '&a ' for green text
# The number of lines output must be specified (lines: #), or set to zero if no output should be generated.
# Each line must be labeled with 'line-#:' where # is the line order, and # should begin with 1
# "Variables" must be enclosed in "[ ]" and must be proceeded and followed by a space (' ').
#
# The following 'variable' codes are supported for messages:
#
# [afk] - Player's Away from Keyboard (AFK) status. ("(AFK)" shown when AFK, otherwise nothing is displayed.)
# [afktime] - How long a player has been AFK for the current login session
# [current] - Player's OnTime for current session (login)
# [daily] - Player's daily OnTime 
# [daysAgo] - Number of calendar days since player's first login to the server
# [daysOn] - The number of different days the player has been on the server
# [lastLogin] - Day/Time stamp of the player's last login
# [monthly] - Player's Monthly OnTime
# [otherPlayer] - Another player's name (only valid for "loginAnnoucement")
# [otherTotal] - Another player's total OnTime (only valid for "loginAnnoucement")
# [player] - Player's in-game name
# [serverName] - Name of your server
