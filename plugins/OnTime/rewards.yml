# OnTime Rewards Configuration YAML
# Author: Edge209
#
# NOTE: (May 27, 2013) In prior versions of the rewards.yml I included a full explanation of the content and format, but
#                      this was leading to problems for new users.  So I have moved this information to a bukkitdev page, so if
#                      your still want the full details please visit "http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/ontime/pages/"

# Worlds enabled for Rewards
#    List here the worlds in which you would like to have rewards enabled.  You can also use
#     "  - global", for permissions plugins that support a "global" configuration that is applied to all worlds.  Alternatively you can use
#     "  - all", in which case OnTime will detect all defined worlds and apply all group and permission changes to each world individually.  This
#                should be used if are using world "mirrors".
